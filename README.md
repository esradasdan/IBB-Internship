# IBB-Internship

This repository contains the daily number of trips and bus departure times that I optimized for the 75-O IETT bus line, which I worked on during my internship at Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB). The most appropriate bus schedule was created using daily passenger movement data from the stops on the route.

First of all, the 75-O line, which does not have many trips in Istanbul and is generally used to go to the intercity bus terminal, was chosen as the route of the project for closer examination. The route continues in both directions between Bus Terminal and Mecidiyek√∂y, with different numbers of trips 7 days a week. If you would like to take a closer look, you can view the current sailing schedule here. Below is the 75-O route.
